# Image Zoom

Image zooming made possible with pure JavaScript.

This project is still under development. [Demo](http://desmonding.me/image-zoom/)

## How to use

1. Include `image-zoom.js` in your page:

```html
<script src="src/image-zoom.js"></script>
```

2. Add `data-action="zoom"` attribute to an image to make it zoomable:

```html
<img src="img/sample.jpg" data-action="zoom" />
```
