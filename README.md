# Image Zoom

Image zooming with pure JavaScript. No dependencies needed. [Demo](http://desmonding.me/image-zoom/)

## How to use

1. Include `image-zoom.js` and `image-zoom.css` in your page:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="src/image-zoom.css">
<script src="src/image-zoom.js"></script>
```

2. Add `data-action="zoom"` attribute to an image to make it zoomable:

```html
<img src="img/sample.jpg" data-action="zoom" />
```
